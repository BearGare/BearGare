# Hey there 👋 I'm Gareth

Sales rep by day, aspiring code whisperer by night.  
Currently deep in the trenches of Python and Go via [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) — learning to understand both what my customers *build* and the secret language my engineers speak when they say “it’s working on my machine.”

---

### 🧠 About Me

I started coding back in school (mostly Python, with the usual HTML/JS detours), tinkered on and off for years, and finally decided to take it seriously.  
Between calls and demos, I now spend my evenings debugging, learning, and convincing myself that “automation” means *less work* — even though configuring Neovim says otherwise.

By day I help enterprise engineering teams ship software faster at [Harness.io](https://www.harness.io).  
By night I tinker with:
- 🐍 Python and 🐹 Go  
- ⚙️ Neovim configs, git workflows, and weird automation experiments  
- 🐧 Eventually Linux (once I’ve earned my command-line scars)  
- 💀 Avoiding Groovy at all costs — because it's time to retire the butler...

### 🚀 What I’m Learning

- Data structures, loops, and functions (Boot.dev’s way)  
- The Zen of Python — one mistake at a time  
- Why CI/CD pipelines are elegant everywhere *except* when written in Groovy  

---

### 📚 Random Lore

- Sci-fi is my comfort food — *Isaac Asimov, William Gibson, Peter Watts, Liu Cixin, Orson Scott Card*  
- Ex-musician, trained actor, former gym manager, and lifelong tinkerer  
- Still waiting for my Neovim config to achieve enlightenment  
- Dream setup: coding in a dark terminal while Foundation plays softly in the background
